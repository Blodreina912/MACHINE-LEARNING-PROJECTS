# MACHINE-LEARNING-PROJECTS

Welcome to the **MACHINE-LEARNING-PROJECTS** repository!

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to machine learning projects, experiments, and resources. Here you can find code, datasets, and documentation for various ML tasks, including but not limited to:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model building (classification, regression, clustering, etc.)
- Model evaluation and tuning
- Deployment examples

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Blodreina912/MACHINE-LEARNING-PROJECTS.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the directory**
   ```bash
   cd MACHINE-LEARNING-PROJECTS
   ```

3. **Set up your environment**
   - It is recommended to use a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
     ```
   - Install dependencies if a `requirements.txt` file is present:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
